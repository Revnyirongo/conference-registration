The Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for the UbuntuNet-Connect conference registration platform is a continuous integration and continuous deployment process that automates the building, testing, and deployment of any changes to the platform's source code hosted on https://github.com/Revnyirongo/conference-registration.

The pipeline is configured to trigger whenever there is a change to the source code on GitHub. The pipeline first checks out the latest version of the source code from the GitHub repository and compiles the code to create a build artifact.

Next, the pipeline runs automated tests to ensure that the new changes do not introduce any bugs or issues that could affect the platform's performance. If the tests are successful, the pipeline proceeds to deploy the new changes to the Docker containerized infrastructure where the platform is hosted.

The deployment process involves several stages, including deploying to a staging environment, running additional tests on the staging environment, and finally deploying to the production environment if all tests pass. The pipeline also ensures that the Docker images used in the deployment process are up to date and have the latest security patches installed.

If any stage of the pipeline fails, an alert is sent to the relevant stakeholders, including the devops team, who will investigate and address the issue to ensure the smooth operation of the platform.

Overall, the Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline provides a reliable and efficient process for managing changes to the UbuntuNet-Connect conference registration platform's source code, ensuring that any changes are thoroughly tested and deployed in a controlled and secure manner.
